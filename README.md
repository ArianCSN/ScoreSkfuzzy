# **Fuzzy Logic-Based Student Performance Assessment**

## **Project Overview:**
The goal of this project is to design a fuzzy logic system that evaluates a student's academic performance based on various input parameters. By considering factors such as midterm scores, end-of-term exam results, homework completion, and class activity participation, the system will generate a final score ranging from 0 to 20.

## **Input Variables:**
1. **Midterm Score:** A numerical value representing the student's performance in the midterm examination.
2. **Endterm Score:** The student's achievement in the end-of-term exam.
3. **Homework Completion:** A measure of how diligently the student completes homework assignments.
4. **Class Activity Participation:** An assessment of the student's engagement during class sessions.

## **Fuzzy Inference System:**
The project will employ fuzzy logic to handle imprecise and uncertain data. Linguistic variables (such as "low," "medium," and "high") will be used to represent the input parameters. Fuzzy membership functions will map these linguistic terms to numerical values.

## **Rules and Aggregation:**
A set of fuzzy rules will guide the inference process. These rules will define how the input variables combine to determine the overall score. The aggregation method will be used to compute the final score.

## **Output:**
The system will produce a crisp output score between 0 and 20, reflecting the student's overall performance. This score can serve as a valuable tool for educators to assess and provide feedback to students.
